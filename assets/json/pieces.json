This insight inspired me to develop Poke Pages, a mobile app designed to fulfill this need and enhance the overall gaming experience. Created over a few months using Adalo, Poke Pages allowed Pokémon Go players to connect, share tips, and coordinate activities, fostering a stronger sense of community. This experimental project was my first foray into mobile app development, and it was successfully launched on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. For a year, it was available for download, earning positive feedback for its contribution to the Pokémon Go community.",

Team collaboration was a highlight, as we combined our assets and ideas to create a cohesive level, and the use of landscape tools enhanced the scene’s natural beauty, drawing from my personal experiences around lakes and ponds.\n\nHowever, the project faced challenges, including asset migration issues and texture streaming pool limitations, which required reducing texture resolutions and re-migrating assets. Despite these hurdles, the experience was rewarding, with lessons learned in managing underground environments and resolving software issues with Perforce. Overall, the project was both enjoyable and educational, and I plan to create a level sequence trailer to showcase the final result.",
